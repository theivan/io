title:      Life is rough.

None of us were given the choice to be here. But here we are. And we make do. In comparison to other animals we are gods.

So we stopped comparing ourselves to animals. We compared ourselves against each other. Yeah, he can do 30 pull-ups, but that guy reps 50. Of course we need a mailman, but you need to strive to be better than that!

Why?

I honestly just don't get it. My parents have told me that they tried to raise me to "make due" with what I have. They also said that they took it too far. First child problems. Oops.

Just to clarify a bit more, I think myself to be fairly unambitious. My end game is pretty simple. I want internet access. I want a roof over my head. I want someone to love and dote on. I want to eat diverse foods. And I want to be near friends.
Money? I don't care about that, never have never will. If I have enough to eat, I'm happy. Career? I won't do something I hate. I think I'd be happy as a mailman. I just want enough pay to be able to sustain myself.

But nobody wants to hear that. I'm an intelligent and attractive young man. "You did what?! Wow dude, are you some kind of genius?" Yes, technically. But what does that matter? "What are you doing with your life? You could be out there helping the world!" This one always hits me with a mix of annoyance and grief. Annoyance because, you should go save the world. Grief because they are totally right.

It's just hard being intelligent sometimes. I don't mean to brag. I just understand some things easier. I come to different conclusions. And because I can do that, people assume that I have to. I'm smart, so I NEED to strive for excellence. I have to give the world something!

No. I don't owe the world anything. Sorry guys. I love people, but I don't think that means I need to serve them. I understand that I could possibly hold within me a recipe for the greatest advancement of all mankind. But that's my prerogative. Just because I am smart does not mean I surrender my freedom.
I don't know. Maybe I don't like these expectations. I hate how everyone says I need to do more so I can be more and have more and more more more. I feel like while I'm thinking "I have one life, lets take it easy and enjoy ourselves!" the people around me say "You have one life, it has to be the best life!" Best, better, more. I'm not about that life. 

You want compassion? You got it. Understanding? I feel you. Love? I'll redefine it for you. But I just can't get behind this idea of success being pushed on me. Maybe I'm just lazy and selfish, but I am here on this earth right now to enjoy MY life, not cater to yours.
