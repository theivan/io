I haven't talked to you for weeks.

I miss you. I miss our little chats. They go from jokes and laughter to our deepest thoughts and feelings and I miss being able to tell you everything.

It's not that we're not still friends, it's just that there seems to be no reason for us to talk anymore. We're busy, with our different lives, hanging out with different people. I don't want to hurt you by bringing you into my life again.

That's why I've given up coming up with reasons to talk to you and it seems you've given up too. You'll probably be receiving a text from me in the next month or so though and I look forward to to talking to you then.

Just do me a favour, do find yourself.
