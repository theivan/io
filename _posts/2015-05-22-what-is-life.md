A board-game that sucks, a cereal that’s awesome, a magazine that’s owned by boys, and the inconceivable act of dynamic matter gathering, moving, self-propelling itself first to form, then to mind, and eventually SOMEHOW, to consciousness, so that you can ponder the cosmos and bask in the warmth of love amongst manmade canyons while celebrating the otherwise pointless anniversary of not the day you were formed, nor thought your first thought, but rather the moment you drew your first breath on this en-tirelessly pointless spinning rock that not only posses life, but is absolutely covered by it.
