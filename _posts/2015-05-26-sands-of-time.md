summary:    Why do you exist?
---

According to [population.io](http://population.io), I am one of 7,317,843,550 - make that 7,317,843, 562 (and counting). So, what make me unique? Hell, what makes any of us unique? As far as we know we all exist on a cosmological speck of dust floating somewhere in space in time. And yet, we're born, we grow, we dream, we aspire, we learn, we grow old and we die. In the infiniteness of the universe, we track the progression of time and will ourselves to create the tools to control it's progression and it's effects.

So, what makes us special? What makes us unique? I would argue that it's our capacity to learn - over our capacity to create. You see, how long would you or I live? And how many years of this life would we actually use to create something unique from utter nothingness? Are you starting to see where I am going with this?

From the dawn of history, we've learned from each other - generation after generation. If it were not for the written word, the thoughts, ideas and ponderings of our early ancestors would have been lost and would not have been read, digested, discussed, rendered, altered, amended and (ultimately) rewritten - for you and I to read from today - so that we too could then digest, discuss, render, alter, amend and refashion it to the way we see fit.

So, it would seem that this is what makes us special. We have evolved through the history of our species, through the gift of the written word. However trivial some long lost book or pamphlet was thought to have been during it's time of production, it has (in some way, shape or form) added to the overall stash of our species' cumulative knowledge. Accordingly, it would follow that a life well spent is one that has added to this 'stash' in a certain degree or another and therefore contributing to our species evolvement.

Think of that the next time you wake up in the morning and you feel like your life is a waste. It's your choice whether you want to help our species conquer the odds of time or not.
