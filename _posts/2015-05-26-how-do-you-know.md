summary:    Before and after.
---

There was a before and after with you - a chasm unlike that which any other event that any one person has ever caused in my life. I can count the days since every major meeting or conversation that we’ve had. I know that there are no red flags here. I know that you wouldn’t hurt me like the others have. I know with certainty that you are good, and that certainty, alive and well inside a cynical soul, has not survived in me many times before. I knew from the first second we spoke that you were going to take me on an adventure, wanted or not. I always hear the phrase "you're one in a million." I see it more like "you're a million good things in one." And I know that you're human just like me. I know you have flaws. I'm not naive in thinking that you will take away everything that could make me unhappy or turn my life into a fairytale. I am realistic if anything. We're all people here. There's just no reason for us to have to be alone. 

I know that you are someone I see the possibility of being beside for the long run, but I choose to focus more intently on the fact that I never want to be away from you.

If this is cause for concern of a possible psychosis, a creation in my mind because I'm an artist, or God's gentle push in the seeming right direction. Whatever insanity you've caused in me for these months, I choose to call it art. I’d call dreaming a futile task if it weren’t for the fact that I can’t imagine any future without you in it. 

If you left now, I’d spend time with a map figuring how long it would take to get where you are. 

That’s how I know.
