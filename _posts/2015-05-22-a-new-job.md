Two days. It's been two days. I just started a new job as a Content Manager, and I'm tired. No real surprise there I guess. So many new impressions and new things to learn.  
If you had asked me two years ago I would never have guessed that I would have worked with a fashion brand today. But here I am, all with the fashion. It's nice to be noticed for the way you look. Dressing well and looking well. Who would have thought, me of all people.

Who am I then? Born and raised in Stockholm. I work in front of computers all day, every day. I'm single, thirty-something and on Tinder. I write, I code and I design. I like wine (not red), beer and cocktails. I have a few really close friends and few not so close friends.

What will I write about? Whatever comes springs to mind really. Life, dating, work. Anything. This blog is to become my anonymous outlet. Hopefully I will reach someone.
